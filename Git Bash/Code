--The term project files must be located in the user directory default to git unless otherwise changed by the user.
--Run the following commands in a git bash shell before ssh. This command will upload a the file name specified to the server.

scp project_datasets.zip <username>@XXX.XXX.XXX.XX:/home/<username>

--User will be asked for a password. Provide the user password.

--To unzip the datasets:  
unzip project_datasets.zip

--To view current files under the home directory:
ls

--Create directories to store the project dataset files. Each file must be at a different directory.
hdfs dfs -mkdir term_project_files
hdfs dfs -mkdir term_project_files/file1
hdfs dfs -mkdir term_project_files/file2

--You may create as many directories as needed. Directory names are recommended to resemble the file it contains.

--To check that all directories has been created:
hdfs dfs -ls term_project_files
hdfs dfs -ls term_project_files/file1
hdfs dfs -ls term_project_files/file2

--The following command will put the project dataset files into the recently created directories.
hdfs dfs -put file1 term_project_files/file1
hdfs dfs -put file1 term_project_files/file2

--You mayt put all files by changing the name and the target directory.

--To ensure that all files are in place, execute the following command:
hdfs dfs -ls term_project_files
hdfs dfs -ls term_project_files/file1
hdfs dfs -ls term_project_files/file2

--You may execute this command as needed to ensure all files are in the designated directories

--At this point, all work with Hadoop is done and we can move to Hive.

--Execute the following command to enter the Hive CLI:
hive

--Once loaded into hive, create a database for the project by executing the following HiveQL command:
CREATE DATABASE [database_name];

--Please note that Hive is not case sensitive and words typed in uppercase are a convention and usually are keywords.

--Once the database has been created, execute the following command to use it:
USE [database_name];

--Now, the system is ready to create all tables and perform the analysis.
--You may use the code under
